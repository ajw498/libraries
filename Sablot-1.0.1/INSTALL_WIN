1. Intro
========================================

Sablotron is based on Expat XML parser. 

There is a significant change of how Expat is used since version
0.50. Sablotron _never_ looks for Expat under its own source tree, but
it supposes, that you have installed Expat library (1.95.1 or later) 
in your system.

To get Expat, visit

http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/

and download/install source/binary package.


2. Sablotron binaries
========================================

Download and extract the binary package. The only requirement is that 
expat.dll must be installed in your system. You can download
the Sablot dll as binary from http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/.
If you download a Windows binary of expat you have to rename it to expat.dll
(without a version number). Ensure expat.dll is on your PATH.

Copy sablot.dll and sabcmd.exe somewhere to your PATH.

2.1. Binaries and dependencies
------------------------------

To support other than built-in charsets you must use the iconv library.
To support JavaScript extensions you must use JS library by Mozilla.
For your convenience, There is a Sablotron binary package available 
supporting both iconv and JavaScript. This package 
(Sablot-Win-x.xx-FullPack.zip) actualy contains three independent products:

- Sablotron binary (linking iconv)
- iconv binary (look at ftp://ftp.ilog.fr/pub/Users/haible/gnu/ for sources)
- JavaScript binary (look at http://www.mozilla.org/js/ for sources)

Copy iconv.dll, js32.exe, sablot.dll and sabcmd.exe somewhere to your PATH.


3. Building Sablotron from sources
========================================

If you have downloaded the binary distribution, you can skip reading this
section.

To build Sablotron from sources you have to build expat first. Download
expat sources from http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/ and build it
(project file for MS DevStudio 6.0 is included).

Sablotron can be built with many different options. These options are defined
in sablot_config.msvc file. You can either edit this file or preferably create
its local copy named sablot_config.local. The config file itself is rather
self-decriptive. 

The recommended procedure is the following:

1. copy sablot_config.msvc to sablot_config.local
2. edit sablot_config.local
3. type 'nmake -f makefile.msvc' 

Then install the Sablotron DLL and executable as described in section 2. 
Make sure expat.dll (iconv.dll, js32.dll) are on your PATH (if you link them).


3.1. Notes on dependencies
--------------------------

Iconv is a library for encoding conversions. You don't need to have it 
installed, but in that case, you will only be able to use a few encodings. 
Sablot has been tested on NT with Bruno Haible's implementation of iconv, 
available from ftp://ftp.ilog.fr/pub/Users/haible/gnu/libiconv-1.3.tar.gz

If you change the way Sablot or iconv are being built, make sure they both 
use the DLL version of the C runtime library (msvcrt.dll), i.e. compile 
with /MD. This is because they need to share the global variable errno.

JavaScript is the popular Netscape-developed object scripting language. 
Sablotron has to link the JS engine to enable extension functions. 
See http://www.mozilla.org/js/ for more details or to get sources.
