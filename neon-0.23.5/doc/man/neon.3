.TH "NEON" 3 " 8 October 2002" "neon 0.23.5" "neon API reference"
.SH NAME
neon \- HTTP and WebDAV client library
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
neon is an HTTP and WebDAV client library. The major abstractions exposed are the HTTP session, created by \fBne_session_create\fR(3); and the HTTP request, created by \fBne_request_create\fR(3). HTTP authentication is handled transparently for server and proxy servers, see \fBne_set_server_auth\fR(3); complete SSL/TLS support is also included, see \fBne_ssl_set_verify\fR(3).

.SH "CONVENTIONS"

.PP
Some conventions are used throughout the neon API, to provide a consistent and simple interface; these are documented below.

.SS "Thread-safeness and global initialization"

.PP
neon itself is implemented to be thread-safe (avoiding any use of global state), but in some configurations makes use of other libraries which require global initialization. The \fBne_sock_init\fR(3) function should be called before any other use of the neon library interface.

.SS "Namespaces"

.PP
The neon header files reserve the use of the prefixes ne_ and NE_.

.SS "URI paths, WebDAV metadata"

.PP
The path strings passed to any function must be URI-encoded by the application: neon never performs any URI encoding or decoding automatically. WebDAV property names and values must be used un UTF-8.

.SS "Memory handling"

.PP
neon does not attempt to cope gracefully with an out-of-memory situation; instead, by default, \fBabort\fR is called to terminate the application. Optionally an application-provided function be called before abort; see \fBne_oom_callback\fR(3).

.SS "Callbacks and userdata"

.PP
Whenever a callback is registered, a userdata variable is also used to allow the application to associate a context with the callback. The userdata is of type \fBvoid *\fR, allowing any pointer to be used.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
