---------------------------

* server auth should not run on a CONNECT request; once a connection
  has been CONNECT tunneled, subsequent requests through the tunnel
  should not give proxy auth.

* SSL fails on platforms without a /dev/random. Need a mini-PRNG, or
  just require EGD where necessary.

* what is passed as 'path' to req create hook: auth needs Request-URI;
  how does that interact with proxies?  also they will be passed NULL
  for a CONNECT request, or "*" possibly as well.

* compress code should not try to inflateFree if inflateInit fails.

* XML API should not expose expat/libxml difference where attrs array may 
  be NULL or non-NULL to startelm callbacks.

* when name resolution returns >1 IP address, should cycle through
  addresses if connect to first one fails.

* expect100 support is broken.

* It would be nice to fail with a friendly error message if a client
cert is requested by the srever but one is not provided.  Currently,
returning -1 from the provide_client_cert function would allow that
(as it forces the SSL handshake to fail), but that would prevent
opportunistic use of client certificates, of the "SSLVerifyClient
optional" variety.
