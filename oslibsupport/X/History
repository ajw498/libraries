950410	    Original version in osLib.examples
970913	TV  Amendments for StronArm compatibility.
      	    Instead of setting up the return block on the stack, it is now set up in
      	    a static data array. Up to 256 entries are allowed.
981221  TV  fixed bug giving wrong offsets in International_Error.
      	    International_error was defined as a variable size, yet a pointer based
      	    on os_error was used to access its components. Changed to two os_error 
      	    pointers
